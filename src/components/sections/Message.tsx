            Our startup is not just an extension of a business—it's the first
            step in a bold challenge to create the new future of Gacha
            <sup>2</sup>.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating from university, I joined Lulark Co., Ltd.
            (formerly Daichou Shouji Co., Ltd.) and immersed myself in the Gacha
            <sup>2</sup> industry. I started in field sales and worked my way up
            to store manager, area manager, and buyer, eventually returning to
            the capsule toy division after about ten years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Six months after being reassigned as deputy division head, I was
            promoted to division head. In just one year, I succeeded in turning
            around a business that had been unprofitable for the past 20 years
            and made it profitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, I envisioned a capsule toy specialty store called "Gacha
            Gacha Forest." Overcoming internal opposition, I made it a reality.
            Within just seven years, this new venture grew to a scale of 10
            billion yen in sales, completely transforming the business model of
            the capsule toy industry. Thanks to this initiative, the domestic
            market expanded nearly four times.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, with growth comes maturity, and the limits of the domestic
            market have become clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the global market still holds unlimited potential. However,
            within the existing framework, speed and freedom are limited. To
            overcome this dilemma and bring the future I envision to life, I
            chose the path of entrepreneurship.
          </p>
          <p className="font-semibold">
            The company's goal is to build a global platform as a new offline
            business. We are fully committed to becoming a unicorn company at
            the heart of this vision.
